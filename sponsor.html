<p>Hackference is coming around again and we want to make it as good as it can be for our attendees!</p>
<p>Not only do we want to provide a fantastic conference at a reasonable price, but we want to make another fantastic free hackathon as well</p>
<p>Other the course of the three days, sponsors will be in front of over 300 developers from all over the UK and some from further a field.</p>
<p>We're lucky at Hackference to have a diverse mixture of attendees, previous event's have had plenty of student, startup, corporate and freelance attendees from all over the skill spectrum</p>
